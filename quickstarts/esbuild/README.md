# ES Build

Example of transpiling from ES6 to older ES5 JS for compatibility.


## Packages used

- ES Build
- Lodash


## Install

```sh
$ npm i
```


## Build

This will create the `build` directory, compile the JS entry-point and dependencies and write to `build`.

```sh
$ npm run build
```

There is no frontend to view but you can see the [build](build/) directory.
